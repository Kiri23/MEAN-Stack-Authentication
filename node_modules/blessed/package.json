It's completely\nimplemented in javascript, and its goal consists of two things:\n\n1. Reimplement ncurses entirely by parsing and compiling terminfo and termcap,\nand exposing a `Program` object which can output escape sequences compatible\nwith _any_ terminal.\n\n2. Implement a widget API which is heavily optimized for terminals.\n\nThe blessed renderer makes use of CSR (change-scroll-region), and BCE\n(back-color-erase). It draws the screen using the painter's algorithm and is\nsped up with smart cursor movements and a screen damage buffer. This means\nrendering of your application will be extremely efficient: blessed only draws\nthe changes (damage) to the screen.\n\nBlessed is arguably as accurate as ncurses, but even more optimized in some\nways. The widget library gives you an API which is reminiscent of the DOM.\nAnyone is able to make an awesome terminal application with blessed. There are\nterminal widget libraries for other platforms (primarily [python][urwid] and\n[perl][curses-ui]), but blessed is possibly the most DOM-like (dare I say the\nmost user-friendly?).\n\nBlessed has been used to implement other popular libraries and programs.\nExamples include: the [slap text editor][slap] and [blessed-contrib][contrib].\nThe blessed API itself has gone on to inspire [termui][termui] for Go.\n\n## Install\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install blessed\n```\n\n## Example\n\nThis will render a box with line borders containing the text `'Hello world!'`,\nperfectly centered horizontally and vertically.\n\n__NOTE__: It is recommend you use either `smartCSR` or `fastCSR` as a\n`blessed.screen` option. This will enable CSR when scrolling text in elements\nor when manipulating lines.\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed');\n\n// Create a screen object.\nvar screen = blessed.screen({\n  smartCSR: true\n});\n\nscreen.title = 'my window title';\n\n// Create a box perfectly centered horizontally and vertically.\nvar box = blessed.box({\n  top: 'center',\n  left: 'center',\n  width: '50%',\n  height: '50%',\n  content: 'Hello {bold}world{/bold}!',\n  tags: true,\n  border: {\n    type: 'line'\n  },\n  style: {\n    fg: 'white',\n    bg: 'magenta',\n    border: {\n      fg: '#f0f0f0'\n    },\n    hover: {\n      bg: 'green'\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Append our box to the screen.\nscreen.append(box);\n\n// Add a png icon to the box\nvar icon = blessed.image({\n  parent: box,\n  top: 0,\n  left: 0,\n  type: 'overlay',\n  width: 'shrink',\n  height: 'shrink',\n  file: __dirname + '/my-program-icon.png',\n  search: false\n});\n\n// If our box is clicked, change the content.\nbox.on('click', function(data) {\n  box.setContent('{center}Some different {red-fg}content{/red-fg}.{/center}');\n  screen.render();\n});\n\n// If box is focused, handle `enter`/`return` and give us some more content.\nbox.key('enter', function(ch, key) {\n  box.setContent('{right}Even different {black-fg}content{/black-fg}.{/right}\\n');\n  box.setLine(1, 'bar');\n  box.insertLine(1, 'foo');\n  screen.render();\n});\n\n// Quit on Escape, q, or Control-C.\nscreen.key(['escape', 'q', 'C-c'], function(ch, key) {\n  return process.exit(0);\n});\n\n// Focus our element.\nbox.focus();\n\n// Render the screen.\nscreen.render();\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Widgets\n\n- [Base Nodes](#base-nodes)\n  -

The screen to be associated with.\n- __parent__ - The desired parent.\n- __children__ - An arrray of children.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- Inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- __type__ - Type of the node (e.g. `box`).\n- __options__ - Original options object.\n- __parent__ - Parent node.\n- __screen__ - Parent screen.\n- __children__ - Array of node's children.\n- __data, _, $__ - An object for any miscellanous user data.\n- __index__ - Render index (document order index) of the last render call.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- Inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- __adopt__ - Received when node is added to a parent.\n- __remove__ - Received when node is removed from it's current parent.\n- __reparent__ - Received when node gains a new parent.\n- __attach__ - Received when node is attached to the screen directly or\n  somewhere in its ancestry.\n- __detach__ - Received when node is detached from the screen directly or\n  somewhere in its ancestry.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- Inherits all from EventEmitter.\n- __prepend(node)__ - Prepend a node to this node's children.\n- __append(node)__ - Append a node to this node's children.\n- __remove(node)__ - Remove child node from node.\n- __insert(node, i)__ - Insert a node to this node's children at index `i`.\n- __insertBefore(node, refNode)__ - Insert a node to this node's children\n  before the reference node.\n- __insertAfter(node, refNode)__ - Insert a node from node after the reference\n  node.\n- __detach()__ - Remove node from its parent.\n- __emitDescendants(type, args..., [iterator])__ - Emit event for element, and\n  recursively emit same event for all descendants.\n- __get(name, [default])__ - Get user property with a potential default value.\n- __set(name, value)__ - Set user property to value.\n\n\n#### Screen (from Node)\n\nThe screen on which every other node renders.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- __program__ - The blessed `Program` to be associated with. Will be\n  automatically instantiated if none is provided.\n- __smartCSR__ - Attempt to perform CSR optimization on all possible elements\n  (not just full-width ones, elements with uniform cells to their sides).\n  This is known to cause flickering with elements that are not full-width,\n  however, it is more optimal for terminal rendering.\n- __fastCSR__ - Do CSR on any element within 20 cols of the screen edge on\n  either side. Faster than `smartCSR`, but may cause flickering depending on\n  what is on each side of the element.\n- __useBCE__ - Attempt to perform `back_color_erase` optimizations for terminals\n  that support it. It will also work with terminals that don't support it, but\n  only on lines with the default background color. As it stands with the current\n  implementation, it's uncertain how much terminal performance this adds at the\n  cost of overhead within node.\n- __resizeTimeout__ - Amount of time (in ms) to redraw the screen after the\n  terminal is resized (Default: 300).\n- __tabSize__ - The width of tabs within an element's content.\n- __autoPadding__ - Automatically position child elements with border and\n  padding in mind (__NOTE__: this is a recommended option. It may become\n  default in the future).\n- __cursor.artificial__ - Have blessed draw a custom cursor and hide the\n  terminal cursor (__experimental__).\n- __cursor.shape__ - Shape of the cursor. Can be: block, underline, or line.\n- __cursor.blink__ - Whether the cursor blinks.\n- __cursor.color__ - Color of the color. Accepts any valid color value (`null`\n  is default).\n- __log__ - Create a log file. See `log` method.\n- __dump__ - Dump all output and input to desired file. Can be used together\n  with `log` option if set as a boolean.\n- __debug__ - Debug mode. Enables usage of the `debug` method. Also creates a\n  debug console which will display when pressing F12. It will display all log\n  and debug messages.\n- __ignoreLocked__ - Array of keys in their full format (e.g. `C-c`) to ignore\n  when keys are locked or grabbed. Useful for creating a key that will _always_\n  exit no matter whether the keys are locked.\n- __dockBorders__ - Automatically \"dock\" borders with other elements instead of\n  overlapping, depending on position (__experimental__). For example:\n  These border-overlapped elements:\n```\n┌─────────┌─────────┐\n│ box1    │ box2    │\n└─────────└─────────┘\n```\n  Become:\n```\n┌─────────┬─────────┐\n│ box1    │ box2    │\n└─────────┴─────────┘\n```\n- __ignoreDockContrast__ - Normally, dockable borders will not dock if the\n  colors or attributes are different. This option will allow them to dock\n  regardless. It may produce some odd looking multi-colored borders though.\n- __fullUnicode__ - Allow for rendering of East Asian double-width characters,\n  utf-16 surrogate pairs, and unicode combining characters. This allows you to\n  display text above the basic multilingual plane. This is behind an option\n  because it may affect performance slightly negatively. Without this option\n  enabled, all double-width, surrogate pair, and combining characters will be\n  replaced by `'??'`, `'?'`, `''` respectively. (NOTE: iTerm2 cannot display\n  combining characters properly. Blessed simply removes them from an element's\n  content if iTerm2 is detected).\n- __sendFocus__ - Send focus events after mouse is enabled.\n- __warnings__ - Display warnings (such as the output not being a TTY, similar\n  to ncurses).\n- __forceUnicode__ - Force blessed to use unicode even if it is not detected\n  via terminfo, env variables, or windows code page. If value is `true` unicode\n  is forced. If value is `false` non-unicode is forced (default: `null`).\n- __input/output__ - Input and output streams. `process.stdin`/`process.stdout`\n  by default, however, it could be a `net.Socket` if you want to make a program\n  that runs over telnet or something of that nature.\n- __terminal__ - `TERM` name used for terminfo parsing. The `$TERM` env variable is\n  used by default.\n- __title__ - Set the terminal window title if possible.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- Inherits all from Node.\n- __program__ - The blessed Program object.\n- __tput__ - The blessed Tput object (only available if you passed `tput: true`\n  to the Program constructor.)\n- __focused__ - Top of the focus history stack.\n- __width__ - Width of the screen (same as `program.cols`).\n- __height__ - Height of the screen (same as `program.rows`).\n- __cols__ - Same as `screen.width`.\n- __rows__ - Same as `screen.height`.\n- __left__ - Relative left offset, always zero.\n- __right__ - Relative right offset, always zero.\n- __top__ - Relative top offset, always zero.\n- __bottom__ - Relative bottom offset, always zero.\n- __aleft__ - Absolute left offset, always zero.\n- __aright__ - Absolute right offset, always zero.\n- __atop__ - Absolute top offset, always zero.\n- __abottom__ - Absolute bottom offset, always zero.\n- __grabKeys__ - Whether the focused element grabs all keypresses.\n- __lockKeys__ - Prevent keypresses from being received by any element.\n- __hover__ - The currently hovered element. Only set if mouse events are bound.\n- __terminal__ - Set or get terminal name. `Set` calls `screen.setTerminal()`\n  internally.\n- __title__ - Set or get window title.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- Inherits all from Node.\n- __resize__ - Received on screen resize.\n- __mouse__ - Received on mouse events.\n- __keypress__ - Received on key events.\n- __element [name]__ - Global events received for all elements.\n- __key [name]__ - Received on key event for [name].\n- __focus, blur__ - Received when the terminal window focuses/blurs. Requires a\n  terminal supporting the focus protocol and focus needs to be passed to\n  program.enableMouse().\n- __prerender__ - Received before render.\n- __render__ - Received on render.\n- __warning__ - Received when blessed notices something untoward (output is not\n  a tty, terminfo not found, etc).\n- __destroy__ - Received when the screen is destroyed (only useful when using\n  multiple screens).\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- Inherits all from Node.\n- __log(msg, ...)__ - Write string to the log file if one was created.\n- __debug(msg, ...)__ - Same as the log method, but only gets called if the\n  `debug` option was set.\n- __alloc()__ - Allocate a new pending screen buffer and a new output screen\n  buffer.\n- __realloc()__ - Reallocate the screen buffers and clear the screen.\n- __draw(start, end)__ - Draw the screen based on the contents of the screen\n  buffer.\n- __render()__ - Render all child elements, writing all data to the screen\n  buffer and drawing the screen.\n- __clearRegion(x1, x2, y1, y2)__ - Clear any region on the screen.\n- __fillRegion(attr, ch, x1, x2, y1, y2)__ - Fill any region with a character\n  of a certain attribute.\n- __focusOffset(offset)__ - Focus element by offset of focusable elements.\n- __focusPrevious()__ - Focus previous element in the index.\n- __focusNext()__ - Focus next element in the index.\n- __focusPush(element)__ - Push element on the focus stack (equivalent to\n  `screen.focused = el`).\n- __focusPop()__ - Pop element off the focus stack.\n- __saveFocus()__ - Save the focused element.\n- __restoreFocus()__ - Restore the saved focused element.\n- __rewindFocus()__ - \"Rewind\" focus to the last visible and attached element.\n- __key(name, listener)__ - Bind a keypress listener for a specific key.\n- __onceKey(name, listener)__ - Bind a keypress listener for a specific key\n  once.\n- __unkey(name, listener)__ - Remove a keypress listener for a specific key.\n- __spawn(file, args, options)__ - Spawn a process in the foreground, return to\n  blessed app after exit.\n- __exec(file, args, options, callback)__ - Spawn a process in the foreground,\n  return to blessed app after exit.

Useful for\nwriting a terminal multiplexer, or something similar to an mc-like file\nmanager. Requires term.js and pty.js to be installed. See\n`example/multiplex.js` for an example terminal multiplexer.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __handler__ - Handler for input data.\n- __shell__ - Name of shell. `$SHELL` by default.\n- __args__ - Args for shell.\n- __cursor__ - Can be `line`, `underline`, and `block`.\n- __terminal__ - Terminal name (Default: `xterm`).\n- __env__ - Object for process env.\n- Other options similar to term.js'.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __term__ - Reference to the headless term.js terminal.\n- __pty__ - Reference to the pty.js pseudo terminal.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __title__ - Window title from terminal.\n- Other events similar to ScrollableBox.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __write(data)__ - Write data to the terminal.\n- __screenshot([xi, xl, yi, xl])__ - Nearly identical to `element.screenshot`,\n  however, the specified region includes the terminal's _entire_ scrollback,\n  rather than just what is visible on the screen.\n- Other methods similar to ScrollableBox.\n\n\n#### Image (from Box)\n\nDisplay an image in the terminal (jpeg, png, gif) using either blessed's\ninternal png/gif-to-terminal renderer (using a [ANSIImage element](#ansiimage-from-box)) or\nusing `w3mimgdisplay` (using a [OverlayImage element](#overlayimage-from-box)).\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __file__ - Path to image.\n- __type__ - `ansi` or `overlay`. Whether to render the file as ANSI art or\n  using `w3m` to overlay. See the [ANSIImage element](#ansiimage-from-box) for\n  more information/options. (__default__: `ansi`).\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- See [ANSIImage element](#ansiimage-from-box)\n- See [OverlayImage element](#overlayimage-from-box)\n\n##### Events:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- See [ANSIImage element](#ansiimage-from-box)\n- See [OverlayImage element](#overlayimage-from-box)\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- See [ANSIImage element](#ansiimage-from-box)\n- See [OverlayImage element](#overlayimage-from-box)\n\n\n#### ANSIImage (from Box)\n\nConvert any `.png` file (or `.gif`, see below) to an ANSI image and display it\nas an element. This differs from the `OverlayImage` element in that it uses\nblessed's internal PNG/GIF parser and does not require external dependencies.\n\nBlessed uses an internal from-scratch PNG/GIF reader because no other javascript\nPNG reader supports Adam7 interlaced images (much less pass the png test\nsuite).\n\nThe blessed PNG reader supports adam7 deinterlacing, animation (APNG), all\ncolor types, bit depths 1-32, alpha, alpha palettes, and outputs scaled bitmaps\n(cellmaps) in blessed for efficient rendering to the screen buffer. It also\nuses some code from libcaca/libcucul to add density ASCII characters in order\nto give the image more detail in the terminal.\n\nIf a corrupt PNG or a non-PNG is passed in, blessed will display error text in\nthe element.\n\n`.gif` files are also supported via a javascript implementation (they are\ninternally converted to bitmaps and fed to the PNG renderer). Any other image\nformat is support only if the user has imagemagick (`convert` and `identify`)\ninstalled.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __file__ - URL or path to PNG/GIF file. Can also be a buffer.\n- __scale__ - Scale cellmap down (`0-1.0`) from its original pixel width/height\n  (Default: `1.0`).\n- __width/height__ - This differs from other element's `width` or `height` in\n  that only one of them is needed: blessed will maintain the aspect ratio of\n  the image as it scales down to the proper number of cells. __NOTE__: PNG/GIF's\n  are always automatically shrunken to size (based on scale) if a `width` or\n  `height` is not given.\n- __ascii__ - Add various \"density\" ASCII characters over the rendering to give\n  the image more detail, similar to libcaca/libcucul (the library mplayer uses\n  to display videos in the terminal).\n- __animate__ - Whether to animate if the image is an APNG/animating GIF. If\n  false, only display the first frame or IDAT (Default: `true`).\n- __speed__ - Set the speed of animation. Slower: `0.0-1.0`. Faster: `1-1000`.\n  It cannot go faster than 1 frame per millisecond, so 1000 is the fastest.\n  (Default: 1.0)\n- __optimization__ - `mem` or `cpu`. If optimizing for memory, animation frames\n  will be rendered to bitmaps _as the animation plays_, using less memory.\n  Optimizing for cpu will precompile all bitmaps beforehand, which may be\n  faster, but might also OOM the process on large images. (Default: `mem`).\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __img__ - Image object from the png reader.\n- __img.width__ - Pixel width.\n- __img.height__ - Pixel height.\n- __img.bmp__ - Image bitmap.\n- __img.cellmap__ - Image cellmap (bitmap scaled down to cell size).\n\n##### Events:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __setImage(file)__ - Set the image in the box to a new path. File can be a\n  path, url, or buffer.\n- __clearImage()__ - Clear the image.\n- __play()__ - Play animation if it has been paused or stopped.\n- __pause()__ - Pause animation.\n- __stop()__ - Stop animation.\n\n\n#### OverlayImage (from Box)\n\nDisplay an image in the terminal (jpeg, png, gif) using w3mimgdisplay. Requires\nw3m to be installed. X11 required: works in xterm, urxvt, and possibly other\nterminals.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __file__ - Path to image.\n- __ansi__ - Render the file as ANSI art instead of using `w3m` to overlay\n  Internally uses the ANSIImage element. See the [ANSIImage element](#ansiimage-from-box) for\n  more information/options. (Default: `true`).\n- __w3m__ - Path to w3mimgdisplay. If a proper `w3mimgdisplay` path is not\n  given, blessed will search the entire disk for the binary.\n- __search__ - Whether to search `/usr`, `/bin`, and `/lib` for\n  `w3mimgdisplay` (Default: `true`).\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __setImage(img, [callback])__ - Set the image in the box to a new path.\n- __clearImage([callback])__ - Clear the current image.\n- __imageSize(img, [callback])__ - Get the size of an image file in pixels.\n- __termSize([callback])__ - Get the size of the terminal in pixels.\n- __getPixelRatio([callback])__ - Get the pixel to cell ratio for the terminal.\n- _Note:_ All methods above can be synchronous as long as the host version of\n  node supports `spawnSync`.\n\n\n#### Video (from Box)\n\nA box which spins up a pseudo terminal in order to render a video via `mplayer\n-vo caca` or `mpv --vo caca`. Requires `mplayer` or `mpv` to be installed with\nlibcaca support.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __file__ - Video to play.\n- __start__ - Start time in seconds.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n- __tty__ - The terminal element running `mplayer` or `mpv`.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- Inherits all from Box.\n\n\n#### Layout (from Element)\n\nA layout which can position children automatically based on a `renderer` method\n(__experimental__ - the mechanics of this element may be changed in the\nfuture!).\n\nBy default, the Layout element automatically positions children as if they were\n`display: inline-block;` in CSS.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Inherits all from Element.\n- __renderer__ - A callback which is called right before the children are\n  iterated over to be rendered. Should return an iterator callback which is\n  called on each child element: __iterator(el, i)__.\n- __layout__ - Using the default renderer, it provides two layouts: inline, and\n  grid. `inline` is the default and will render akin to `inline-block`. `grid`\n  will create an automatic grid based on element dimensions. The grid cells'\n  width and height are always determined by the largest children in the layout.\n\n##### Properties:\n\n- Inherits all from Element.\n\n##### Events:\n\n- Inherits all from Element.\n\n##### Methods:\n\n- Inherits all from Element.\n- __renderer(coords)__ - A callback which is called right before the children\n  are iterated over to be rendered. Should return an iterator callback which is\n  called on each child element: __iterator(el, i)__.\n- __isRendered(el)__ - Check to see if a previous child element has been\n  rendered and is visible on screen. This is __only__ useful for checking child\n  elements that have already been attempted to be rendered! see the example\n  below.\n- __getLast(i)__ - Get the last rendered and visible child element based on an\n  index. This is useful for basing the position of the current child element on\n  the position of the last child element.\n- __getLastCoords(i)__ - Get the last rendered and visible child element coords\n  based on an index. This is useful for basing the position of the current\n  child element on the position of the last child element. See the example\n  below.\n\n##### Rendering a Layout for child elements\n\n###### Notes\n\nYou must __always__ give `Layout` a width and height. This is a chicken-and-egg\nproblem: blessed cannot calculate the width and height dynamically _before_ the\nchildren are positioned.\n\n`border` and `padding` are already calculated into the `coords` object the\n`renderer` receives, so there is no need to account for it in your renderer.\n\nTry to set position for children using `el.position`. `el.position` is the most\nprimitive \"to-be-rendered\" way to set coordinates. Setting `el.left` directly\nhas more dynamic behavior which may interfere with rendering.\n\nSome definitions for `coords` (otherwise known as `el.lpos`):\n\n- `coords.xi` - the absolute x coordinate of the __left__ side of a rendered\n  element. It is absolute: relative to the screen itself.\n- `coords.xl` - the absolute x coordinate of the __right__ side of a rendered\n  element. It is absolute: relative to the screen itself.\n- `coords.yi` - the absolute y coordinate of the __top__ side of a rendered\n  element. It is absolute: relative to the screen itself.\n- `coords.yl` - the absolute y coordinate of the __bottom__ side of a rendered\n  element. It is absolute: relative to the screen itself.\n\nNote again: the `coords` the renderer receives for the Layout already has\nborder and padding subtracted, so you do not have to account for these. The\nchildren do not.\n\n###### Example\n\nHere is an example of how to provide a renderer. Note that this is also the\ndefault renderer if none is provided. This renderer will render each child as\nthough they were `display: inline-block;` in CSS, as if there were a\ndynamically sized horizontal grid from left to right.\n\n``` js\nvar layout = blessed.layout({\n  parent: screen,\n  top: 'center',\n  left: 'center',\n  width: '50%',\n  height: '50%',\n  border: 'line',\n  style: {\n    bg: 'red',\n    border: {\n      fg: 'blue'\n    }\n  },\n  // NOTE: This is already the default renderer if none is provided!\n  renderer: function(coords) {\n    var self = this;\n\n    // The coordinates of the layout element\n    var width = coords.xl - coords.xi\n      , height = coords.yl - coords.yi\n      , xi = coords.xi\n      , xl = coords.xl\n      , yi = coords.yi\n      , yl = coords.yl;\n\n    // The current row offset in cells (which row are we on?)\n    var rowOffset = 0;\n\n    // The index of the first child in the row\n    var rowIndex = 0;\n\n    return function iterator(el, i) {\n      // Make our children shrinkable. If they don't have a height, for\n      // example, calculate it for them.\n      el.shrink = true;\n\n      // Find the previous rendered child's coordinates\n      var last = self.getLastCoords(i);\n\n      // If there is no previously rendered element, we are on the first child.\n      if (!last) {\n        el.position.left = 0;\n        el.position.top = 0;\n      } else {\n        // Otherwise, figure out where to place this child. We'll start by\n        // setting it's `left`/`x` coordinate to right after the previous\n        // rendered element. This child will end up directly to the right of it.\n        el.position.left = last.xl - xi;\n\n        // If our child does not overlap the right side of the Layout, set it's\n        // `top`/`y` to the current `rowOffset` (the coordinate for the current\n        // row).\n        if (el.position.left + el.width <= width) {\n          el.position.top = rowOffset;\n        } else {\n          // Otherwise we need to start a new row and calculate a new\n          // `rowOffset` and `rowIndex` (the index of the child on the current\n          // row).\n          rowOffset += self.children.slice(rowIndex, i).reduce(function(out, el) {\n            if (!self.isRendered(el)) return out;\n            out = Math.max(out, el.lpos.yl - el.lpos.yi);\n            return out;\n          }, 0);\n          rowIndex = i;\n          el.position.left = 0;\n          el.position.top = rowOffset;\n        }\n      }\n\n      // If our child overflows the Layout, do not render it!\n      // Disable this feature for now.\n      if (el.position.top + el.height > height) {\n        // Returning false tells blessed to ignore this child.\n        // return false;\n      }\n    };\n  }\n});\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  blessed.box({\n    parent: layout,\n    width: i % 2 === 0 ? 10 : 20,\n    height: i % 2 === 0 ? 5 : 10,\n    border: 'line'\n  });\n}\n```\n\n\n### Other\n\n\n#### Helpers\n\nAll helpers reside on `blessed.helpers` or `blessed`.\n\n- __merge(a, b)__ - Merge objects `a` and `b` into object `a`.\n- __asort(obj)__ - Sort array alphabetically by `name` prop.\n- __hsort(obj)__ - Sort array numerically by `index` prop.\n- __findFile(start, target)__ - Find a file at `start` directory with name\n  `target`.\n- __escape(text)__ - Escape content's tags to be passed into `el.setContent()`.\n  Example: `box.setContent('escaped tag: ' + blessed.escape('{bold}{/bold}'));`\n- __parseTags(text)__ - Parse tags into SGR escape codes.\n- __generateTags(style, text)__ - Generate text tags based on `style` object.\n- __attrToBinary(style, element)__ - Convert `style` attributes to binary\n  format.\n- __stripTags(text)__ - Strip text of tags and SGR sequences.\n- __cleanTags(text)__ - Strip text of tags, SGR escape code, and\n  leading/trailing whitespace.\n- __dropUnicode(text)__ - Drop text of any >U+FFFF characters.\n\n\n### Mechanics\n\n\n#### Content & Tags\n\nEvery element can have text content via `setContent`. If `tags: true` was\npassed to the element's constructor, the content can contain tags. For example:\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/bold}{/green-bg}{/red-fg}');\n```\n\nTo make this more concise `{/}` cancels all character attributes.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/}');\n```\n\n\n##### Colors\n\nBlessed tags support the basic 16 colors for colors, as well as up to 256\ncolors.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}world{/}');\n```\n\nTags can also use hex colors (which will be reduced to the most accurate\nterminal color):\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello {#ff0000-fg}{#00ff00-bg}world{/}');\n```\n\n\n##### Attributes\n\nBlessed supports all terminal attributes, including `bold`, `underline`,\n`blink`, `inverse`, and `invisible`.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello {bold}world{/bold}');\n```\n\n\n##### Alignment\n\nNewlines and alignment are also possible in content.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('hello\\n'\n  + '{right}world{/right}\\n'\n  + '{center}foo{/center}\\n');\n  + 'left{|}right');\n```\n\nThis will produce a box that looks like:\n\n```\n| hello                 |\n|                 world |\n|          foo          |\n| left            right |\n```\n\n\n##### Escaping\n\nEscaping can either be done using `blessed.escape()`\n\n```\nbox.setContent('here is an escaped tag: ' + blessed.escape('{bold}{/bold}'));\n```\n\nOr with the special `{open}` and `{close}` tags:\n\n```\nbox.setContent('here is an escaped tag: {open}bold{close}{open}/bold{close}');\n```\n\nEither will produce:\n\n```\nhere is an escaped tag: {bold}{/bold}\n```\n\n\n##### SGR Sequences\n\nContent can also handle SGR escape codes. This means if you got output from a\nprogram, say `git log` for example, you can feed it directly to an element's\ncontent and the colors will be parsed appropriately.\n\nThis means that while `{red-fg}foo{/red-fg}` produces `^[[31mfoo^[[39m`, you\ncould just feed `^[[31mfoo^[[39m` directly to the content.\n\n\n#### Style\n\nThe style option controls most of the visual aspects of an element.\n\n``` js\n  style: {\n    fg: 'blue',\n    bg: 'black',\n    bold: true,\n    underline: false,\n    blink: false,\n    inverse: false,\n    invisible: false,\n    transparent: false,\n    border: {\n      fg: 'blue',\n      bg: 'red'\n    },\n    scrollbar: {\n      bg: 'blue'\n    },\n    focus: {\n      bg: 'red'\n    },\n    hover: {\n      bg: 'red'\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n\n##### Colors\n\nColors can be the names of any of the 16 basic terminal colors, along with hex\nvalues (e.g. `#ff0000`) for 256 color terminals. If 256 or 88 colors is not\nsupported. Blessed with reduce the color to whatever is available.\n\n\n##### Attributes\n\nBlessed supports all terminal attributes, including `bold`, `underline`,\n`blink`, `inverse`, and `invisible`. Attributes are represented as bools in the\n`style` object.\n\n\n##### Transparency\n\nBlessed can set the opacity of an element to 50% using `style.transparent =\ntrue;`. While this seems like it normally shouldn't be possible in a terminal,\nblessed will use a color blending algorithm to blend the element of the\nforemost element with the background behind it. Obviously characters cannot be\nblended, but background colors can.\n\n\n##### Shadow\n\nTranslucent shadows are also an option when it comes to styling an element.\nThis option will create a 50% opacity 2-cell wide, 1-cell high shadow offset to\nthe bottom-right.\n\n``` js\nshadow: true\n```\n\n\n##### Effects\n\nBlessed supports hover and focus styles. (Hover is only useful is mouse input\nis enabled).\n\n``` js\n  style: {\n    hover: {\n      bg: 'red'\n    },\n    focus: {\n      border: {\n        fg: 'blue'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n\n##### Scrollbar\n\nOn scrollable elements, blessed will support style options for the scrollbar,\nsuch as:\n\n``` js\nstyle: {\n  scrollbar: {\n    bg: 'red',\n    fg: 'blue'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs a main option, scrollbar will either take a bool or an object:\n\n``` js\nscrollbar: {\n  ch: ' '\n}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n``` js\nscrollbar: true\n```\n\n\n#### Events\n\nEvents in Blessed work similar to the traditional node.js model, with one\nimportant difference: they have a concept of a tree and event bubbling.\n\n\n##### Event Bubbling\n\nEvents can bubble in blessed. For example:\n\nReceiving all click events for `box` (a normal event listener):\n\n``` js\nbox.on('click', function(mouse) {\n  box.setContent('You clicked ' + mouse.x + ', ' + mouse.y + '.');\n  screen.render();\n});\n```\n\nReceiving all click events for `box`, as well as all of its children:\n\n``` js\nbox.on('element click', function(el, mouse) {\n  box.setContent('You clicked '\n    + el.type + ' at ' + mouse.x + ', ' + mouse.y + '.');\n  screen.render();\n  if (el === box) {\n    return false; // Cancel propagation.\n  }\n});\n```\n\n`el` gets passed in as the first argument. It refers to the target element the\nevent occurred on. Returning `false` will cancel propagation up the tree.\n\n\n#### Positioning\n\nOffsets may be a number, a percentage (e.g. `50%`), or a keyword (e.g.\n`center`).\n\nDimensions may be a number, or a percentage (e.g. `50%`).\n\nPositions are treated almost _exactly_ the same as they are in CSS/CSSOM when\nan element has the `position: absolute` CSS property.\n\nWhen an element is created, it can be given coordinates in its constructor:\n\n``` js\nvar box = blessed.box({\n  left: 'center',\n  top: 'center',\n  bg: 'yellow',\n  width: '50%',\n  height: '50%'\n});\n```\n\nThis tells blessed to create a box, perfectly centered __relative to its\nparent__, 50% as wide and 50% as tall as its parent.\n\nPercentages can also have offsets applied to them:\n\n``` js\n  ...\n  height: '50%-1',\n  left: '45%+1',\n  ...\n```\n\nTo access the calculated offsets, relative to the parent:\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(box.left);\nconsole.log(box.top);\n```\n\nTo access the calculated offsets, absolute (relative to the screen):\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(box.aleft);\nconsole.log(box.atop);\n```\n\n\n##### Overlapping offsets and dimensions greater than parents'\n\nThis still needs to be tested a bit, but it should work.\n\n\n#### Rendering\n\nTo actually render the screen buffer, you must call `render`.\n\n``` js\nbox.setContent('Hello {#0fe1ab-fg}world{/}.');\nscreen.render();\n```\n\nElements are rendered with the lower elements in the children array being\npainted first. In terms of the painter's algorithm, the lowest indicies in the\narray are the furthest away, just like in the DOM.\n\n\n#### Artificial Cursors\n\nTerminal cursors can be tricky. They all have different custom escape codes to\nalter. As an _experimental_ alternative, blessed can draw a cursor for you,\nallowing you to have a custom cursor that you control.\n\n``` js\nvar screen = blessed.screen({\n  cursor: {\n    artificial: true,\n    shape: 'line',\n    blink: true,\n    color: null // null for default\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThat's it. It's controlled the same way as the regular cursor.\n\nTo create a custom cursor:\n\n``` js\nvar screen = blessed.screen({\n  cursor: {\n    artificial: true,\n    shape: {\n      bg: 'red',\n      fg: 'white',\n      bold: true,\n      ch: '#'\n    },\n    blink: true\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n#### Multiple Screens\n\nBlessed supports the ability to create multiple screens. This may not seem\nuseful at first, but if you're writing a program that serves terminal\ninterfaces over http, telnet, or any other protocol, this can be very useful.\n\n##### Server Side Usage\n\nA simple telnet server might look like this (see examples/blessed-telnet.js for\na full example):\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed');\nvar telnet = require('telnet');\n\ntelnet.createServer(function(client) {\n  client.do.transmit_binary();\n  client.do.terminal_type();\n  client.do.window_size();\n\n  client.on('terminal type', function(data) {\n    if (data.command === 'sb' && data.name) {\n      screen.terminal = data.name;\n      screen.render();\n    }\n  });\n\n  client.on('window size', function(data) {\n    if (data.command === 'sb') {\n      client.columns = data.columns;\n      client.rows = data.rows;\n      client.emit('resize');\n    }\n  });\n\n  // Make the client look like a tty:\n  client.setRawMode = function(mode) {\n    client.isRaw = mode;\n    if (!client.writable) return;\n    if (mode) {\n      client.do.suppress_go_ahead();\n      client.will.suppress_go_ahead();\n      client.will.echo();\n    } else {\n      client.dont.suppress_go_ahead();\n      client.wont.suppress_go_ahead();\n      client.wont.echo();\n    }\n  };\n  client.isTTY = true;\n  client.isRaw = false;\n  client.columns = 80;\n  client.rows = 24;\n\n  var screen = blessed.screen({\n    smartCSR: true,\n    input: client,\n    output: client,\n    terminal: 'xterm-256color',\n    fullUnicode: true\n  });\n\n  client.on('close', function() {\n    if (!screen.destroyed) {\n      screen.destroy();\n    }\n  });\n\n  screen.key(['C-c', 'q'], function(ch, key) {\n    screen.destroy();\n  });\n\n  screen.on('destroy', function() {\n    if (client.writable) {\n      client.destroy();\n    }\n  });\n\n  screen.data.main = blessed.box({\n    parent: screen,\n    left: 'center',\n    top: 'center',\n    width: '80%',\n    height: '90%',\n    border: 'line',\n    content: 'Welcome to my server. Here is your own private session.'\n  });\n\n  screen.render();\n}).listen(2300);\n```\n\nOnce you've written something similar and started it, you can simply telnet\ninto your blessed app:\n\n``` bash\n$ telnet localhost 2300\n```\n\nCreating a netcat server would also work as long as you disable line buffering\nand terminal echo on the commandline via `stty`:\n`$ stty -icanon -echo; ncat localhost 2300; stty icanon echo`\n\nOr by using netcat's `-t` option: `$ ncat -t localhost 2300`\n\nCreating a streaming http 1.1 server than runs in the terminal is possible by\ncurling it with special arguments: `$ curl -sSNT. localhost:8080`.\n\nThere are currently no examples of netcat/nc/ncat or http->curl servers yet.\n\n---\n\nThe `blessed.screen` constructor can accept `input`, `output`, and `term`\narguments to aid with this. The multiple screens will be managed internally by\nblessed. The programmer just has to keep track of the references, however, to\navoid ambiguity, it's possible to explicitly dictate which screen a node is\npart of by using the `screen` option when creating an element.\n\nThe `screen.destroy()` method is also crucial: this will clean up all event\nlisteners the screen has bound and make sure it stops listening on the event\nloop. Make absolutely certain to remember to clean up your screens once you're\ndone with them.\n\nA tricky part is making sure to include the ability for the client to send the\nTERM which is reset on the serverside, and the terminal size, which is should\nalso be reset on the serverside. Both of these capabilities are demonstrated\nabove.\n\nFor a working example of a blessed telnet server, see\n`examples/blessed-telnet.js`.\n\n\n### Notes\n\n\n#### Windows Compatibility\n\nCurrently there is no `mouse` or `resize` event support on Windows.\n\nWindows users will need to explicitly set `term` when creating a screen like so\n(__NOTE__: This is no longer necessary as of the latest versions of blessed.\nThis is now handled automatically):\n\n``` js\nvar screen = blessed.screen({ terminal: 'windows-ansi' });\n```\n\n\n#### Low-level Usage\n\nThis will actually parse the xterm terminfo and compile every\nstring capability to a javascript function:\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed');\n\nvar tput = blessed.tput({\n  terminal: 'xterm-256color',\n  extended: true\n});\n\nprocess.stdout.write(tput.setaf(4) + 'Hello' + tput.sgr0() + '\\n');\n```\n\nTo play around with it on the command line, it works just like tput:\n\n``` bash\n$ tput.js setaf 2\n$ tput.js sgr0\n$ echo \"$(tput.js setaf 2)Hello World$(tput.js sgr0)\"\n```\n\nThe main functionality is exposed in the main `blessed` module:\n\n``` js\nvar blessed = require('blessed')\n  , program = blessed.program();\n\nprogram.key('q', function(ch, key) {\n  program.clear();\n  program.disableMouse();\n  program.showCursor();\n  program.normalBuffer();\n  process.exit(0);\n});\n\nprogram.on('mouse', function(data) {\n  if (data.action === 'mousemove') {\n    program.move(data.x, data.y);\n    program.bg('red');\n    program.write('x');\n    program.bg('!red');\n  }\n});\n\nprogram.alternateBuffer();\nprogram.enableMouse();\nprogram.hideCursor();\nprogram.clear();\n\nprogram.move(1, 1);\nprogram.bg('black');\nprogram.write('Hello world', 'blue fg');\nprogram.setx((program.cols / 2 | 0) - 4);\nprogram.down(5);\nprogram.write('Hi again!');\nprogram.bg('!black');\nprogram.feed();\n```\n\n\n#### Testing\n\nMost tests contained in the `test/` directory are interactive. It's up to the\nprogrammer to determine whether the test is properly displayed. In the future\nit might be better to do something similar to vttest.\n\n\n#### Examples\n\nExamples can be found in `examples/`.\n\n\n#### FAQ\n\n1. Why doesn't the Linux console render lines correctly on Ubuntu?\n  - You need to install the `ncurses-base` package __and__ the `ncurses-term`\n    package. (#98)\n2. Why do vertical lines look chopped up in iTerm2?\n  - All ACS vertical lines look this way in iTerm2 with the default font.\n3. Why can't I use my mouse in Terminal.app?\n  - Terminal.app does not support mouse events.\n4. Why doesn't the OverlayImage element appear in my terminal?\n  - The OverlayImage element uses w3m to display images. This generally only\n    works on X11+xterm/urxvt, but it _may_ work on other unix terminals.\n5. Why can't my mouse clicks register beyond 255 cells?\n  - Older versions of VTE do not support any modern mouse protocol. On top of\n    that, the old X10 protocol it _does_ implement is bugged. Through several\n    workarounds we've managed to get the cell limit from `127` to `255`. If\n    you're not happy with this, you may want to look into using xterm or urxvt,\n    or a terminal which uses a modern VTE, like gnome-terminal.\n6. Is blessed efficient?\n  - Yes. Blessed implements CSR and uses the painter's algorithm to render the\n    screen. It maintains two screen buffers so it only needs to render what\n    has changed on the terminal screen.\n7. Will blessed work with all terminals?\n  - Yes. Blessed has a terminfo/termcap parser and compiler that was written\n    from scratch. It should work with every terminal as long as a terminfo\n    file is provided. If you notice any compatibility issues in your termial,\n    do not hesitate to post an issue.\n8. What is \"curses\" and \"ncurses\"?\n  - [\"curses\"][curses] was an old library written in the early days of unix\n    which allowed a programmer to easily manipulate the cursor in order to\n    render the screen. [\"ncurses\"][ncurses] is a free reimplementation of\n    curses. It improved upon it quite a bit by focusing more on terminal\n    compatibility and is now the standard library for implementing terminal\n    programs. Blessed uses neither of these, and instead handles terminal\n    compatibility itself.\n9. What is the difference between blessed and blessed-contrib?\n  - blessed is a major piece of code which reimplements curses from the ground\n    up. A UI API is then layered on top of this. [blessed-contrib][contrib] is\n    a popular library built on top of blessed which makes clever use of modules\n    to implement useful widgets like graphs, ascii art, and so on.\n10. Are there blessed-like solutions for non-javascript platforms?\n  - Yes. There are some fantastic solutions out there.\n    - Perl: [Curses::UI][curses-ui]\n    - Python: [Urwid][urwid]\n    - Go: [termui][termui] & [termbox-go][termbox]\n\n\n## Contribution and License Agreement\n\nIf you contribute code to this project, you are implicitly allowing your code\nto be distributed under the MIT license.
