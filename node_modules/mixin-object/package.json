Pass an empty object as the first arg to shallow clone.\n\nIf you only want to combine own-properties, use [extend-shallow](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow).\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n\n```sh\n$ npm i mixin-object --save\n```\n\nInstall with [bower](http://bower.io/)\n\n```sh\n$ bower install mixin-object --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar mixin = require('mixin-object');\n\nvar obj = {c: 'c'};\nvar foo = mixin({a: 'a'}, {b: 'b'});\nconsole.log(foo);\n//=> {c: 'c', a: 'a', b: 'b'}\nconsole.log(obj);\n//=> {c: 'c'}\n\nmixin({}, {a: 'a'}, {b: 'b'});\n//=> {a: 'a', b: 'b'}\n```\n\n## Related\n\n* [assign-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep): Deeply assign the enumerable properties of source objects to a destination object.\n* [defaults-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/defaults-deep): Like `extend` but recursively copies only the missing properties/values to the target object.\n* [extend-shallow](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util.\n* [for-own](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/for-own): Iterate over the own enumerable properties of an object, and return an object with properties… [more](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/for-own)\n* [for-in](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/for-in): Iterate over the own and inherited enumerable properties of an objecte, and return an object… [more](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/for-in)\n* [isobject](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/isobject): Returns true if the value is an object and not an array or null.\n* [is-plain-object](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-plain-object): Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor.\n* [mixin-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/mixin-deep): Deeply mix the properties of objects into the first object. Like merge-deep, but doesn't clone.\n* [merge-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/merge-deep): Recursively merge values in a javascript object.\n\n## Running tests\n\nInstall dev dependencies:\n\n```sh\n$ npm i -d && npm test\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
